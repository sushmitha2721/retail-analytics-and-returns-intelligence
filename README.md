# 🛒 Retail Analytics & Returns Intelligence System
## End-to-End Python ETL + MySQL Data Analytics Project

## 📌 Overview
The Retail Analytics & Returns Intelligence System transforms raw retail transaction data into a clean, structured, and analytics-ready dataset that reveals insights about sales performance, customer behaviour, product patterns, and return activity.

The system combines a Python ETL pipeline for data cleaning and standardization with SQL classification models that categorize sales and returns into meaningful business concepts. Analytical SQL modules then calculate trends, behaviors, and operational indicators across the retail dataset.

This project showcases practical skills in Python, SQL, data cleaning, business intelligence, and analytical storytelling.
