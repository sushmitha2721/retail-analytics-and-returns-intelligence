# 🛒 Retail Analytics & Returns Intelligence System
## End-to-End Python ETL + MySQL Data Analytics Project

## 📌 Overview
The Retail Analytics & Returns Intelligence System transforms raw retail transaction data into a clean, structured, and analytics-ready dataset that reveals insights about sales performance, customer behaviour, product patterns, and return activity.

The system combines a Python ETL pipeline for data cleaning and standardization with SQL classification models that categorize sales and returns into meaningful business concepts. Analytical SQL modules then calculate trends, behaviors, and operational indicators across the retail dataset.

This project showcases practical skills in Python, SQL, data cleaning, business intelligence, and analytical storytelling.

## 🎯 Objective

The objective of this project is to convert messy raw retail data into a structured, intelligent dataset that supports decision-making across sales, product performance, customer behaviour, and return activity.

The goals include:

- Standardizing and cleaning product descriptions using fuzzy matching

- Recovering missing or inconsistent customer information

- Categorizing sales and returns into meaningful business groups

- Building a return-intelligence layer to detect cancellations, damaged goods, shipping issues, system errors, high-value returns, and suspicious discount activity

- Generating insights about revenue trends, return patterns, and customer behaviour
